## Spatial Point Pattern Analysis of Healthcare Facilities in Cambodia

Group Members: Akshaya Natarajan, Viddyasri Subramaniam

\
In this project, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of healthcare facility distribution in Cambodia. Given Cambodia's unique geographical and demographic characteristics, examining the placement of healthcare facilities in relation to population distribution can offer valuable insights into the accessibility of healthcare across various regions, including cities, towns, and rural areas. By studying the distribution of healthcare facilities, we seek to identify areas with limited access to healthcare services and understand the factors contributing to such disparities.

We have chosen Cambodia due to its proximity to Singapore and its uniform Coordinate Reference System (CRS), which allows for accurate projection of our data. Cambodia, being a small country, provides a manageable dataset for analysis. Furthermore, analyzing healthcare facility distribution in Cambodia can provide insights into broader human development indicators, such as education levels, nutrition, and mortality rates, within different Cambodian localities(provinces, districts, villages).

By understanding the spatial distribution of healthcare resources and its correlation with socio-economic factors, we aim to inform policy-making and resource allocation decisions to improve healthcare accessibility and outcomes across Cambodia.

We aim to execute our analysis via a three pronged approach:

-   Exploratory Data Analysis of the aspatial and geospatial data

-   Network Constrained Kernel Density Estimation of healthcare facilities

-   Spatial Autocorrelation of healthcare facilities
