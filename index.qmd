## Spatial Point Pattern Analysis of Healthcare Facilities in Cambodia

Group Members: Akshaya Natarajan, Viddyasri Subramaniam

In this project, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of healthcare facility distribution in Cambodia. Given Cambodia's unique geographical and demographic characteristics, examining the placement of healthcare facilities in relation to population distribution can offer valuable insights into the accessibility of healthcare across various regions, including districts, communes, and village areas.

This project aims to democratize spatial analysis, making it accessible and insightful for users regardless of their experience level. This in turn allows all users to explore the spatial distribution of healthcare facilities and its correlation with other socio-economic factors.

Our application for spatial point pattern analysis comprises a three pronged approach:

-   Exploratory Data Analysis of Geospatial and Population data

-   Network Constrained Spatial Point Pattern Analysis

-   Spatial Autocorrelation of Healthcare Facilities
