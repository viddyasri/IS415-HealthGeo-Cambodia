## Spatial Point Pattern Analysis of Healthcare Facilities in Cambodia

![](/Images/Hospital%20building-cuate.png){width="464"}

### **1. Background**

Access to healthcare facilities is a cornerstone of public health, playing a critical role in disease prevention, timely intervention, and the overall enhancement of health outcomes. The accessibility of healthcare services is a multifaceted concept encompassing geographical proximity, transportation infrastructure, and the availability of diverse medical facilities. In the context of Cambodia, a nation marked by diversity and a vast population, understanding the dynamics of healthcare accessibility becomes paramount for effective public health management.

In Cambodia, the healthcare landscape exhibits significant variations across regions, where urban areas often boast more robust healthcare infrastructure compared to remote and rural regions. This disparity in accessibility to healthcare facilities presents a considerable challenge, potentially impeding prompt diagnosis and treatment of illnesses. Such spatial inequalities contribute to divergent health outcomes, particularly impacting marginalized populations who encounter obstacles in accessing medical services.

### **2. Motivation**

Recognizing the pivotal role of accessible healthcare, conducting a spatial point pattern analysis becomes an invaluable tool for understanding the distribution of healthcare infrastructure. 

Therefore, we aim to provide a user-friendly app for spatial point pattern analysis, designed to simplify complex analytical processes for users of all backgrounds. Our motivation is rooted in the belief that everyone should have easy access to powerful spatial analysis tools, without the need for extensive coding knowledge or technical expertise. 

With a straightforward interface and compatibility across various operating systems, our app aims to democratize spatial analysis, making it accessible and insightful for users regardless of their experience level. 

### **3. Objectives**

-   Employ geospatial mapping techniques to visually represent the distribution of healthcare facilities and other socio-economic factors across regions of different sizes in Cambodia - provinces, districts, communes, and villages.

-   Apply spatial analysis methods to assess spatial distribution of points while considering network connectivity and evaluate spatial dependence or similarity between neighboring observations.

### **4. Data**

This project will utilize a number of data sets, which are:

-   Healthcare facility locations, namely
    -   Location of health centers
    -   Location of health posts
    -   Location of national hospitals
    -   Location of referral hospitals
-   Population information
-   Road network data
-   Cambodia boundary layer
    -   Level 1 - Province
    -   Level 2 - District
    -   Level 3 - Commune
    -   Level 4 - Village

### **5. Features**

**Exploratory Data Analysis and Geo-visualization:**

This feature aims to provide users with an intuitive understanding of the current distribution of healthcare facilities and other indicators through interactive point maps and choropleth maps. 

**Network Constrained Spatial Point Pattern Analysis:**

This feature aims to offer insights into healthcare facility distribution based on the road network, allowing users to analyze spatial point patterns while considering the constraints imposed by a network topology. In addition, users can conduct K and G function analysis which provides insights into the spatial dependence, highlighting areas of clustering, dispersion, or randomness.

**Spatial Autocorrelation:**

This feature aims to unveil spatial patterns of healthcare accessibility disparities by identifying regions with significant positive or negative autocorrelation. Users gain insights into clusters of high accessibility (positive autocorrelation) or low accessibility (negative autocorrelation). 

### **6. Literature Review**

#### 6.1 Assessing the availability of primary health care services in Chamarajanagara district using kernel density estimation 

**Aim Of Study:**

To assess the availability of Primary Health Centers in Chamarajanagara District using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for assessing population coverage of health services.

**Methodology**:

It calculates accessibility ratios such as Population to Primary Health Centre (PHC) and Population to Health Workforce using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). 

**Learning Points**:\
1.  *Use of KDE:* It emphasizes the use of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to spread discrete facility location data over a continuous space, which could improve the representation of healthcare service availability and accessibility. KDE can consider the relationship between the population and healthcare facilities more effectively, providing a continuous surface representation that is not limited by administrative boundaries.

2\. *Healthcare Accessibility Assessment:* It illustrates how KDE can be used to calculate population-to-facility or staffing ratios, which can inform potential healthcare accessibility and could be beneficial for healthcare service planning.

#### 6.2 Spatial autocorrelation analysis of health care hotspots in Taiwan in 2006

**Aim Of Study:**

1\. To develop a method to ascertain the spatial clustering of the 20 leading healthcare events, using medical data collected by the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) agency.

2\. To investigate the potential spatial risk factors contributing to these healthcare events and to redefine epidemiologic data with spatial references.

**Methodology**:

It utilizes spatial autocorrelation methodologies, including Global Moran's I and Local Getis-Ord statistics, to describe and map spatial clusters, and areas in which these are situated, for the 20 leading causes of death in Taiwan. In addition, it uses the fit to a logistic regression model to test the characteristics of similarity and dissimilarity by gender.

**Learning Points**:

1\. *Spatial Autocorrelation:* The paper shows how to assess spatial autocorrelation using Global Moran's I statistic;  we may use this to determine which areas in our study have a high or low density of healthcare facilities.

2\. *Local Spatial Clusters:* By using the Local G-statistic (Gi\*) to find local spatial clusters of healthcare events, we can determine the precise locations of concentrated healthcare facilities

3\. *Incorporation of Demographic Data:* The study integrates demographic data for more accurate health event mapping, which is essential for considering population distribution in your accessibility analysis.
